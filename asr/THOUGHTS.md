I'm trying to figure out how I would train a speech model. For other things like image recognition, drawing, you just feed it images.

But what about voice? Same idea?

I really want to do it "raw" (lol) as in no thoughts about stuff going remote/into someone's storage

I'm already spent today so just looking around, found this:
